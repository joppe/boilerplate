# Boilerplate

I use this project as a boilerplate for projects and libraries that use TypeScript.

To start a project use:
`node ./script/setup.js p <project_name>`

To start a library use:
`node ./script/setup.js l <library_name>`

Start a project/lib by doing:

- `mkdir <project_name>`
- `cd <project_name>`
- `git clone https://github.com/joppe/boilerplate.git .`
- `node ./script/setup.js l <project_name>`
- `rm -rf script`
- `rm -rf .git`
- ... do the steps to create a new project described as on github.com
