# Boilerplate

I use this project as my boilerplate for projects that use TypeScript.
For testing I use Karma and Jasmine.
For compiling TypeScript to JavaScript I use Webpack.

There is a Makefile included, with the following tasks:

- setup, create folder structure
- typescript, compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- lint, lint the TypeScript
- karma, apply all tests
- clean, remove node_modules directory and the compiled JavaScript
