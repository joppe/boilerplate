# Boilerplate

I use this project as a boilerplate for projects that use TypeScript.
For testing I use Webpack, Karma, Jasmine and Istanbul to generate code coverage reports.

There are a couple of npm run scripts included, with the following tasks:

- setup, create folder structure
- build, compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- lint, lint the TypeScript
- test, run all tests
- build, run webpack-dev-server

Start a project by doing:

- `mkdir <project_name>`
- `cd <project_name>`
- `git clone https://github.com/joppe/boilerplate.git .`
- `rm -rf .git`
- ... do the steps to create a new project described as on github.com
